# A Tutorial On The Syntax of Essence#
This document is currently under construction; sorry about that. However, the syntax of Essence# is a superset of the syntax of ANSI-Standard Smalltalk. The recommended primer/tutorial on the syntax and semantics of Smalltalk is [Smalltalk: Getting The Message](http://www.smalltalk.org/articles/article_20100320_a3_Getting_The_Message.html).
